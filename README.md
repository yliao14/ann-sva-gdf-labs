# Forest Scene Practice Project

## Project Description

For this practice assignment, I used Godot to build a simple forest scene with animals like a fox and a giraffe. Through this project, I learned how to set up a scene, organize nodes properly, and place assets within the environment. One of the main challenges I faced was exporting the scene correctly and uploading the project to GitHub.

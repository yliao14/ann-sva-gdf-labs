## Lab-1 Description

For this practice assignment, I used Godot to build a simple forest scene with animals like a fox and a giraffe. Through this project, I learned how to set up a scene, organize nodes properly, and place assets within the environment. One of the main challenges I faced was exporting the scene correctly and uploading the project to GitHub.


## Lab-2 Description

For lab-2 assignment, I used Godot to create a 2D project featuring a controllable character with movement and jump mechanics. I implemented user input to allow the character to move left and right using the arrow keys and jump using the spacebar. Through this project, I learned how to work with CharacterBody2D, set up collision shapes, apply gravity, and use exported variables to adjust movement and jump behavior in the Inspector. One of the main challenges I faced was properly organizing the scene structure to make sure the character was staying on the floor. Also, I debugged some collision issues to ensure the character touched correctly with the floor.
